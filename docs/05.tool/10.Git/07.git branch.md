1. 将本地仓库初始化，并完成第一次 commit
2. 在 GitHub 创建一个远程仓库，初始为空，准备接受本地推送

GitHub 远程仓库创建之后的提示页面，给出了要完成从本地仓库到远程仓库推送（第二种方法）的示例代码：

```sh {2}
git remote add origin https://github.com/Alowree/Fonts.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

> Explain the function of `git branch -M main` and why it is necessary before the push command.

The command `git branch -M main` forcefully renames the current branch to `main`.

- `git branch`: The command for branch-related operations.
- `-M`: A shortcut for `--move --force`. It renames the current branch. If a branch named `main` already exists, it will be overwritten.

Why it's necessary before pushing:

When you create a new repository locally with `git init`, the default branch name might be `master` (depending on your Git version). However, new repositories created on GitHub now default to using `main`.

To avoid a mismatch and to align your local repository with the modern standard used by GitHub, you rename your local master `branch` to `main`.

If you didn't do this, your local default branch would be `master` while the remote's default would be `main`. When you tried to run `git push -u origin main`, it would fail with an error like "src refspec main does not match any" because you don't have a local branch named `main` to push. Renaming it ensures your local and remote branches have the same name, allowing for a clean initial push and proper tracking.

总结一下，示例代码中剩下的三步：

1. 给本地仓库添加远程仓库
2. 为本地仓库的当前分支强行重新命名为 `main`
3. 推送至远程仓库
