# A Comprehensive Guide to Searching in NeoMutt

NeoMutt's power lies in its ability to quickly navigate and manage email without your hands ever leaving the keyboard. Mastering its search and filter capabilities is key to that efficiency. This guide covers everything from basic commands to advanced, combined patterns.

## 1. Key Search Commands

There are two primary ways to find messages in NeoMutt's index (the list of emails): searching and limiting.

| Key     | Command            | Action                                                                              |
| :------ | :----------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/`     | **Search**         | Jumps to the **next** message matching a pattern, keeping all other emails visible. |
| `Esc /` | **Reverse Search** | Jumps to the **previous** message matching a pattern.                               |
| `l`     | **Limit / Filter** | Filters the index view to **only show** messages that match the pattern.            |
| `n`     | **Next Match**     | Search for **next** message that matches the last search or limit pattern.          |

`N` toggles a message's "new" flag. Read more about [NeoMutt - Index Menu](https://neomutt.org/guide/reference#4-2-%C2%A0index-menu)

### When to Use Search vs. Limit

- **Use Search (`/` or `Esc /`) for Navigation:** When you just want to find and jump to a specific email quickly without losing the context of your full mailbox.

- **Use Limit (`l`) for Focus and Bulk Actions:** When you need to work with a specific subset of emails. For example, you could _limit_ to all emails from a specific project (`l~s "Project X"`), tag them all for archival, and then remove the limit.

> **Tip:** To remove a limit and return to the full view, press `l` and enter the pattern `~A` (for "All") or simply enter an empty pattern.

## 2. Basic Search Patterns

The core of NeoMutt's search is using **patterns** prefixed with a tilde (`~`). When you execute a search or limit command, you enter the pattern in the prompt.

### Searching Specific Email Parts

The following patterns allow you to target specific parts of an email:

| Pattern             | Target                               | Example                      |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| `~s "expr"`         | **Subject**                          | `l~s "meeting"`              |
| `~b "expr"`         | **Body**                             | `/~b "Weekly report"`        |
| `~B "expr"`         | **Whole Message** (headers and body) | `l~B "secret-project-code"`  |
| `~f "expr"`         | **From**                             | `l~f "john.doe@example.com"` |
| `~t "expr"`         | **To**                               | `/~t "support@company.com"`  |
| `~c "expr"`         | **Cc/Bcc**                           | `l~c "marketing"`            |
| `~L "expr"`         | **List-ID**                          | `/~L neomutt.org`            |
| `~h 'Header: expr'` | **Header**                           | `l~h 'X-Priority:High'`      |

### Searching Message Status

You can filter based on flags and status:

| Pattern      | Description                                          | Example                         |
| :----------- | :--------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| `~N`         | **New** Messages marked as "new" (never viewed)      | `l~N`                           |
| `~U`         | **Unread** Messages marked as "unread"               | `l~U`                           |
| `~O`         | **Old** Messages that are neither new nor unread     | `l~O`                           |
| `~D`         | **Deleted** Messages marked for Deletion             | `l~D`                           |
| `~F`         | **Flagged** Messages marked as "flagged" (important) | `/~F`                           |
| `~T`         | **Tagged** Messages that have been tagged            | `l~T`                           |
| `~r`         | **Replied** Messages you have replied to             | `l~r`                           |
| `~Q`         | **Queued/Postponed** Messages that are postponed     | `l~Q`                           |
| `~a`         | **Attachements** Messages that have attachments      | `l~a`                           |
| `~d [range]` | **Date Range** Messages within a date range          | `l~d ">2d"` (newer than 2 days) |

## 3. Combining Patterns

You can combine multiple patterns using logical operators for complex searches:

| Operator           | Logic        | Example                                                                     |
| :----------------- | :----------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ` ` (space) or `&` | **AND**      | `l~s project ~f client@` (Subject has "project" **AND** is from "client@")  |
| `\|`               | **OR**       | `l~s "bug" \| ~s "error"` (Subject contains "bug" **OR** "error")           |
| `!`                | **NOT**      | `l~U !~f "newsletter"` (Unread messages that are **NOT** from "newsletter") |
| `()`               | **Grouping** | `l(!~f "mom" & ~a)` (Has an attachment **AND** is **NOT** from "mom")       |

### Combined Examples

- Limit to unread messages from "John" or "Jane":  
  `l~U (~f "John" \| ~f "Jane")`

- Find all non-deleted emails with "invoice" in the subject or body:  
  `/!~D (~s "invoice" \| ~b "invoice")`

- Search for "invoice" in the subject, body, or from a specific sender:  
  `/~s invoice | ~b invoice | ~f billing@`

- Limit to all unread messages that are NOT from "spam@":  
  `l~U & !~f spam@`

### Search Pattern Guideline

Here is a simple guideline for constructing NeoMutt search patterns, focusing on the use of quotes and best practices.

The need for quotes depends entirely on whether your search expression contains a **space** or relies on **variable/command substitution**.

#### 1. When to **Omit** Quotes

(The Simple Case)

**Omit** quotes when your search expression is a single word or a complex Regular Expression (regex) that does **not** contain any literal spaces.

| Scenario            | Pattern Example | Explanation                                                                      |
| :------------------ | :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single Word**     | `/~s project`   | "project" is treated as one search token.                                        |
| **Simple Regex**    | `l~f ^user@`    | The regex is evaluated as a single, contiguous string.                           |
| **Combined Search** | `l~U&~a`        | The `&` is the explicit logical operator, not a space, so grouping isn't needed. |

**Best Practice:** Omit quotes whenever possible for the cleanest, most readable pattern.

#### 2. When to **Use** Quotes

(Grouping is Required)

Quotes are necessary to ensure that a phrase containing spaces is treated as a single, literal search argument, overriding NeoMutt's default behavior of treating spaces as the logical **AND** operator.

##### A. Strong Quoting

(Single Quotes: `'`) - Preferred for Literal Phrases

Use single quotes when you need to search for a literal phrase that includes spaces. This is the safest default for searching text.

| Scenario           | Pattern Example                       | Explanation                                                                        |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Literal Phrase** | `l~b 'quarterly report'`              | Forces NeoMutt to search for the exact phrase "quarterly report" (with one space). |
| **Email Address**  | `/~f 'John Smith <john@example.com>'` | Groups the full name and email address as one search token.                        |

**Best Practice:** Use single quotes (`'`) for all multi-word, literal text searches, as this prevents accidental variable expansion.

##### B. Weak Quoting

(Double Quotes: `"`) - Required for Dynamic Content

Use double quotes only when you need NeoMutt to **interpret** (expand) variables or commands _inside_ the search pattern before executing the search.

- **Variable Expansion**  
  `l~s "Invoice from $USER"`  
  The `$USER` variable is substituted with the current user's name before searching
- **Command Substitution**  
  <code>l~d "<\`date -d '1 month ago' +%Y%m%d\`"</code>  
  The date command inside the backticks (`date -d '1 month ago' +%Y%m%d`) is executed, and its output (e.g., `20250914`) is inserted into the search string  
  The resulting search is `l~d "<20250914"`

::: warning

Note that the last example that contains a `date` command does not work on macOS. The difference occurs because Windows, macOS, and Linux use different implementations of the `date` command with different syntax and options.

## 4. Advanced Tips

### Case Sensitivity

By default, NeoMutt's patterns are often case-insensitive. If you need a case-sensitive search, you generally need to use the full regular expression capabilities.

### Regular Expressions

All search expressions (`expr`) are treated as **POSIX Extended Regular Expressions (ERE)**. This allows for very powerful matching.

- Search for subjects that _start_ with "Re:"
  `/~s "^Re:"`
- Find subjects containing a version number like `v1.2.3`
  `/~s "v1\.2\.3"` (The `.` is escaped to match a literal period)

### Searching by Date

`~d [range]`

| Date Pattern               | Description                             |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `>DD/MM/YYYY`              | After a date                            |
| `<DD/MM/YYYY`              | Before a date                           |
| `DD/MM/YYYY-DD/MM/YYYY`    | Between two dates                       |
| `>Nd`, `>Nw`, `>Nm`, `>Ny` | Newer than N days, weeks, months, years |
| `<Nd`, `<Nw`, `<Nm`, `<Ny` | Older than N days, weeks, months, years |

### Speeding up Body Search

`~b`, `~B`

Searching the body of emails can be slow, especially over an IMAP connection. To dramatically speed this up, NeoMutt can cache message bodies locally.

Add the following to your `~/.config/neomutt/neomuttrc` file, creating the directories if they don't exist:

```muttrc
# ~/.neomuttrc

set header_cache = "~/.cache/neomutt/headers"
set message_cachedir = "~/.cache/neomutt/bodies"
```

The first search in a folder will be slow as it builds the cache, but subsequent searches will be nearly instant.

## 5. General Best Practices

- **Prioritize Specificity**: Always use the most specific search operator (`~s`, `~f`, `~b`) rather than the general whole-message search (`~B`) for better performance.
- **Use Parentheses**: Use parentheses `()` for complex logical operations to ensure correct precedence: `l~s "report" & (~U ~F)`.
- **Enable Caching**: If searching the body (`~b`) of large or remote (IMAP) mailboxes is slow, ensure you have set `$message_cachedir` in your config for a significant speed boost.
