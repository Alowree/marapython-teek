Settings >> Video Mode >> Non-Broadcast >> Vertical HD 30 fps` or `Vertical HD 60 fps

## Ripple All Tracks

If you press the Ripple button and move a clip to the left or right the other clips on that same track will follow. If you press the second Ripple button to the right of the first one it will make the clips on tracks above and below follow.
