> Seller Assurance for E-Commerce Transactions (SAFE-T) claims allow sellers using Prepaid Return Labels (PRL) in the seller-fulfilled network to appeal Amazon's decision to issue a refund to a customer. At Amazon's sole discretion, you may be issued a reimbursement in cases where Amazon determines that you were not at fault.
