# Amazon Influencer Program

_Content creators participating in the Amazon Influencer Program earn affiliate commissions from Amazon for qualifying purchases._

**What is the Amazon Influencer Program?**

The Amazon Influencer Program is an extension of the Amazon Associates (affiliate) program, that brings product-related content from Influencers onto Amazon to help customers research and discover products they might be interested in.

**What is an Influencer?**

An influencer is anyone who has a meaningful social media following. Influencers across any category can participate in this program. Currently you must have a YouTube, Instagram, Tiktok or Facebook account to qualify.

**How do I know when content is from an Influencer?**

Influencer content will always have the name of the program (Amazon Influencer).

**Does Amazon validate or express the opinions made in the content?**

No. Influencers are able to independently determine whether to recommend a product. Amazon does not modify or edit content, as long as they comply with our posting guidelines

**Where does this content come from?**

Amazon takes content provided by Influencers and surfaces the most relevant content for customers during their shopping experience.

**How can I learn more about the influencer making the recommendation?**

Click on the Influencer’s name provided with their content and you will be taken to their profile where they have a bio and a link to their influencer Storefront where you can see more content from that influencer.

**Are Influencers expected to write only positive reviews?**

We don't expect that Influencers/Onsite Associates will write only positive things. We expect that they'll help customers to discover/research products, through critiquing them as well. If an Influencer has a negative comment about a product, it will have no impact on how Amazon shows or promotes that product. Influencers need to comply with our community guidelines

**Are Influencers paid for providing recommendations?**

Content creators participating in the Amazon Influencer Program earn affiliate commissions from Amazon for qualifying purchases.

**How can I join the program?**
