## Enroll in value recovery options

You can select value recovery options and we'll try to recover value on your unfufillable inventory before it is returned or disposed of.

Your unsellable inventory

1. Refurbishment
2. Grade and Resell
3. Liquidations
4. Return or dispose

## Removals: choose return or dispose

Choose Return or Dispose for items in which value cannot be recovered, and for items you want to exclude from the value recovery options.

## 2025-12-01

Remove SFQ-20 (B0D3HCQKPT,B0D3H8PT5C) from the exclude list, so hopefully they get liquidated and not returned to the Portland warehouse and then Hong Kong.

But as according to [FBA Liquidations](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/GYVCG5Q3BEJ6MLMF), product eligibility, SFQ-20 is ineligible for liquidations because it contains a built-in battery and is classified as dangerous goods. We will need to keep monitoring the returned products in the coming two months.
