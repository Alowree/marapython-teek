## Why Restrict Your WooCommerce Store in a Country?

Our online store sells to the US shipping addresses only.

Our current order fulfilment infrastructure does not support shipping to Canada, Mexico or Brazil. Therefore, we are implementing a restriction and will not accept orders from countries and regions outside the US.

## Method 1. Restricting Countries Using WooCommerce Settings

WooCommerce » Settings » General

General options

- Selling location(s): Sell to specific countries
- Sell to specific countries: United States (US)

With the current settings, the non-US customers will still be able to access the shop page and checkout page, but will not be able to "Place order" for non-US shipping addresses. The lock is on the shipping address because only the US addresses, country-wise and state-wise, are available.
