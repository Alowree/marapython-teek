This guide provides a step-by-step process for converting two existing, separate "Simple Products" in WooCommerce into a single "Variable Product." This is a common challenge, for instance, after importing product variations from a marketplace like Amazon, which may appear as individual items in WooCommerce.

The primary goal is to merge these simple products while **preserving the existing product URL, SEO value, and customer history** of one of the products. This method is preferable to creating a new variable product from scratch and deleting the old ones.

We will use two example products for this guide:

- `Sound Rise II - Black` (This will be our base product)
- `Sound Rise II - Wood Taupe`

<!-- more -->

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following plugins installed and activated, as they are essential for a good user experience with variable products:

- **Variation Swatches for WooCommerce**: To display color options as selectable swatches.
- **Variation Images Gallery for WooCommerce**: To allow each product variation to have its own image gallery.

## Step-by-Step Guide

We will use the existing **Sound Rise II - Black** product as the foundation for the new Variable Product and merge the data from the **Sound Rise II - Wood Taupe** product into it.

### Phase 1: Prepare the Existing Products

1.  **Gather Data from the Secondary Product (Wood Taupe):**

    - Navigate to **Products → All Products**.
    - Find the **Sound Rise II - Wood Taupe** Simple Product and click **Edit**.
    - **Crucially, copy its SKU, Price, and Stock Quantity** to a safe place. You will need this information in Phase 4.

2.  **Prepare the Primary Product (Black):**
    - Go back to **Products → All Products**.
    - Find the **Sound Rise II - Black** Simple Product and click **Edit**.
    - **Rename the product** to a generic title that covers all variations, such as `Sound Rise II`. This will become the main name for the single product page.

### Phase 2: Create the "Color" Attribute

If you already have a global `Color` attribute, you can skip this phase.

1.  **Navigate to Attributes:** In the WordPress dashboard, go to **Products → Attributes**.
2.  **Create the Attribute:**
    - **Name:** `Color`
    - Click **Add attribute**.
3.  **Configure Terms:**
    - On the Attributes page, find the new `Color` attribute and click **"Configure terms"**.
    - Add `Black` and `Wood Taupe` as new terms if they don't already exist.

### Phase 3: Convert the Primary Product and Apply Attributes

Now, we'll modify the primary product (which you renamed to "Sound Rise II").

1.  **Change Product Type:**
    - In the **Product data** section, change the dropdown from `Simple product` to **`Variable product`**.
2.  **Go to the Attributes Tab:**
    - Click on the **Attributes** tab.
    - In the dropdown menu, select the global **Color** attribute and click **Add**.
3.  **Configure Attribute Settings:**
    - In the **Value(s)** field, select both **Black** and **Wood Taupe**.
    - **CRITICAL:** Check the box for **"Used for variations"**.
    - Click **Save attributes**.

### Phase 4: Create and Configure Variations

This is where you'll use the data from both original products.

1.  **Go to the Variations Tab:**
    - Click on the **Variations** tab.
2.  **Generate Variations:**
    - From the dropdown menu, select **"Create variations from all attributes"** and click **Go**.
    - Confirm the alert. Two new variation panels, `Black` and `Wood Taupe`, will be created.
3.  **Configure the Black Variation:**
    - Expand the **Black** variation panel.
    - **Image:** Upload the main image for the black product.
    - **SKU, Price, Stock:** Since this was the base product, its original SKU, Price, and Stock data may already be filled in. **Verify** that this information is correct.
    - **Manage Stock:** Ensure this box is checked and the **Stock quantity** is accurate.
4.  **Configure the Wood Taupe Variation:**
    - Expand the **Wood Taupe** variation panel.
    - **Image:** Upload the main image for the wood taupe product.
    - **SKU:** Enter the SKU you saved from the original Wood Taupe product in Phase 1.
    - **Regular Price:** Enter the price you saved.
    - **Manage Stock:** Check this box and enter the stock quantity you saved.
5.  **Save Changes:** Click **Save changes** in the **Product data** box, and then click the main **Update** button to save the product.

### Phase 5: Decommission the Secondary Product

1.  **Verify the New Variable Product:**
    - Go to the product page on your website.
    - Ensure that both the Black and Wood Taupe color swatches are visible and selectable.
    - Check that the product image, price, and stock information update correctly when you switch between variations.
2.  **Delete the Old Simple Product:**
    - Navigate to **Products → All Products**.
    - Find the original **Sound Rise II - Wood Taupe** Simple Product.
    - Hover over it and click **Trash**.

## Final Result

- The original URL of the "Black" product is now the URL for the unified "Sound Rise II" variable product, preserving its SEO value.
- All reviews and sales history from the original black product are retained.
- The inventory and data for the wood taupe variation are now managed correctly within the new variable product structure.

## Known Issues & Workarounds

- **Image Gallery Conflicts:** On wide desktop screens, the main product image gallery may conflict with the variation-specific galleries, causing images to appear squeezed or misaligned. This issue does not typically occur on tablet or mobile views.
- **Product Bundles Incompatibility:** Some product bundling plugins do not support adding individual variations to a bundle.
  - **Workaround:** If you need to include a specific color in a promotion (e.g., a "Home Edition" bundle), you may need to maintain a separate, unlinked Simple Product for that color variation specifically for use in bundles.
