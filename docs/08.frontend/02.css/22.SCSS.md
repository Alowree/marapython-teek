# Getting Started with SCSS

SCSS (Sassy CSS) is a powerful CSS preprocessor that adds features like variables, nesting, and mixins to standard CSS, making your stylesheets more maintainable, scalable, and organized.

## Which Sass Implementation to Use?

There are three main implementations of Sass, but the choice is clear:

- **Dart Sass**: This is the **primary and official implementation**. It's actively maintained, receives new features first, and is the standard for all modern projects.
- **LibSass**: A C/C++ implementation that was once popular for its speed (used by `node-sass`). It is now **deprecated** and lags behind Dart Sass in features.
- **Ruby Sass**: The original implementation. It is also **deprecated** and has been for many years.

**Conclusion:** For any new project, you should use **Dart Sass**.

## Recommended Workflow

The best practice for using Sass in a modern web project is to install it locally and use npm scripts to compile your code.

### 1. Local Installation

Installing Sass on a per-project basis prevents version conflicts and makes your project self-contained.

First, navigate to your project's root directory and ensure you have a `package.json` file. If not, create one:

```sh
npm init -y
```

Next, install Dart Sass as a _development dependency_. It's a tool for your development process, not for the final production code that runs in the browser.

```sh
npm install sass --save-dev
```

### 2. The Core Process

The development workflow with Sass involves three main steps:

1.  **Write Code**: You will write all your styles in `.scss` files. You no longer edit `.css` files directly.
2.  **Compile**: You run a command to compile your `.scss` source file into a standard `.css` file that browsers can read.
3.  **Link CSS**: In your HTML file, you link to the _compiled_ `.css` file, just as you normally would.

### 3. Project Setup and Compilation

Let's walk through a typical project structure.

#### Step 1: Create Your SCSS File

Organize your source files in a dedicated directory, for example, `scss/`.

```
my-project/
└── scss/
    └── main.scss
```

Now, you can write SCSS code with features like variables and nesting.

**`scss/main.scss`:**

```scss
// Define variables for reusable values
$primary-color: #007bff;
$padding: 15px;

body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

// Use nesting to write cleaner, more organized rules
nav {
  background-color: $primary-color;
  padding: $padding;

  ul {
    list-style: none;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
  }

  li {
    display: inline-block;
    margin-right: 20px;
  }

  a {
    color: white;
    text-decoration: none;

    // The '&' refers to the parent selector, 'a'
    &:hover {
      text-decoration: underline;
    }
  }
}
```

#### Step 2: Configure npm Scripts for Compilation

To make compilation easy, add scripts to your `package.json` file.

**`package.json`:**

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "compile:css": "sass scss/main.scss css/style.css",
    "watch:css": "sass --watch scss/main.scss css/style.css"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "sass": "^1.77.2"
  }
}
```

- `"compile:css"`: A one-time command that compiles `scss/main.scss` to `css/style.css`.
- `"watch:css"`: The most useful command for development. It automatically watches for changes in your `.scss` file and recompiles it every time you save.

#### Step 3: Run the Compiler

Now, you can use the scripts from your terminal:

- To compile the CSS once:
  ```sh
  npm run compile:css
  ```
- To start the automatic watcher during development:
  ```sh
  npm run watch:css
  ```

Running either command will generate the compiled `style.css` file in a `css/` directory.

**Generated `css/style.css`:**

```css
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

nav {
  background-color: #007bff;
  padding: 15px;
}
nav ul {
  list-style: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
nav li {
  display: inline-block;
  margin-right: 20px;
}
nav a {
  color: white;
  text-decoration: none;
}
nav a:hover {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

#### Step 4: Link the Compiled CSS in HTML

Finally, link the output `css/style.css` file in your `index.html`. The browser only ever interacts with the compiled CSS.

**`index.html`:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Sass Project</title>
  <!-- Link to the COMPILED CSS file -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
</head>
<body>

  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>

</body>
</html>
```
