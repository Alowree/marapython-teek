帐户状况这个板块其他涵盖了挺多内容，今天先从产品合规这个子块说起。做美国站的商家经常会遇到的电子产品合规要求大致上有两种，一种无线电的 FCC，一个是电池安全相关。

这次被平台抽到的是“纽扣电池和硬币电池以及含此类电池的商品”。

## 后台路径

后台提交文件和报告的路径：

`Menu >> Performance >> Account Health >> Manage your compliance >> Product Compliance Requests`

## 合规资料

以下是亚马逊后台关于此合规要求提供的资料明细：

### General Certificate of Conformity (GCC)

It is a document issued by a manufacturer or importer that declares their products complies with UL 4200A based on test report showing compliance with UL 4200A.

### Product Images

The image must show

1. Model, part or item number of Product
2. Warnings on Packaging (must) and Product battery compartment (if practical).

Must include the following messages in bold and capital letters:

- “WARNING” in black letters on an orange background
- INGESTION HAZARD: This product contains a button or coin cell battery.
- DEATH or serious injury can occur if ingested.
- A swallowed button or coin battery can cause Internal Chemical Burns in as little as 2 hours

### Test Report

Test Report from an ISO 17025 approved lab showing compliance with UL 4200A. The report must reflect:

a) Secure Battery Compartments testing: Products must have child-resistant battery compartments that prevent easy access by young children.

b) Warning Labels: Packaging and the product itself must have clear warnings about the potential choking hazard and the risks associated with button battery ingestion.

## 资料准备

1. GCC 模板在哪里？应该由哪个公司实体来出具 GCC 文件？
2. UL4200A 认证的样品准备和资料准备
