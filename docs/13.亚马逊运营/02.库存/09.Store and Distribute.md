Multi-Channel Distribution

Can I move my inventory from upstream storage to other destinations outside of Amazon?

> Amazon Warehousing and Distribution has launched Multi-Channel Distribution (MCD), which allows you to send bulk inventory to wholesalers, business (B2B) partners and other locations outside of Amazon. Currently, you can send pallets with Amazon-generated industry standard Serial Shipping Container Code (SSCC) labels, along with physical manifests and bills of lading (BoLs) to other destinations outside of Amazon. Throughout 2024, we will expand MCD to serve more channels that have custom labels and electronic data interchange (EDI) compliance requirements.
