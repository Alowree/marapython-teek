This article captures the daily notes that I keep from managing the advertising campaigns on Amazon. The ultimate goal is to streamline a proper workflow for managing ads, particularly adjusting biddings for the base bids and the premiums at three different placements.

## Objective

```md
ACOS = 广告花费 / 广告销售额

     = 平均 CPC x 广告点击数 /（商品单价 x 广告销售数量)

     = 平均 CPC x 广告点击数 /（商品单价 x 广告点击数 x 广告转化率）

     = 平均 CPC /（商品单价 x 广告转化率）
```

Maximum affordable CPC for Charge Rise II - category

| CPC  | U/P   | ACOS   | CVR   |
| ---- | ----- | ------ | ----- |
| 0.50 | 39.99 | 33.16% | 3.77% |
| 0.60 | 39.99 | 39.80% | 3.77% |
| 0.70 | 39.99 | 46.43% | 3.77% |
| 0.80 | 39.99 | 53.06% | 3.77% |

Theoretically, given these three constraints, (Unit Price=39.99, CVR=3.77%, and ACOS<=40%), the average CPC of this ads group should never exceed $0.60.

In short, the day to day task is to decide what bids we should offer for each keyword/asin, so that the target CPC<=0.60 (hence the target ACOS<=40%) of each ads campaign is met.

## Other Goals

There are other important goals, but they are out of the scope of managing ads and require extra resources:

1. increase click through rate (industry average=?)
2. increase clicks (on average 9K click per month)
3. increase conversion rate (on average between 3%-7%)

::: details Note

1. 实际 CPC < 设定 Bid 的底层逻辑
   A. 广告质量得分 (Quality Score) 高：广告相关性（关键词/商品匹配度）、点击率 (CTR) 及转化率 (CVR) 表现优异，触发亚马逊的“动态竞价折扣”，实际扣费低于设定 Bid
   B. 竞争环境宽松：竞品广告主对该关键词/位置出价低，系统无需触发竞价上限即可赢得曝光
   C. 长尾词主导：广告主要触达搜索量低但精准的长尾词，竞争热度低导致 CPC 被压制
2. 预算花不完的核心矛盾
   A. 曝光量不足：广告未获得足够展示机会（可能因竞价过低或广告排名靠后）
   B. 点击率 (CTR) 偏低：广告创意（图片/文案）吸引力不足，用户浏览后不点击
   C. 时段限制：广告活动设置中时段或地域定向过窄，限制了流量覆盖
3. 归因后再决策
   A. 情况 A：展示量低 + CTR 高 + CVR 高 → 流量池过小，需扩量
   B. 情况 B：展示量高 + CTR 低 + CVR 低 → 创意/定向失准，需优化内容
   C. 情况 C：展示量中 + CTR 中 + CVR 中 → 竞价策略保守，可测试提价
