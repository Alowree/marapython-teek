This article captures the weekly notes that I keep from managing the advertising campaigns on Amazon. The ultimate goal is to streamline a proper workflow for managing ads, particularly adjusting biddings for the base bids and the premiums at three different placements.

## Objective

```md
ACOS = 广告花费 / 广告销售额

     = 平均 CPC x 广告点击数 /（商品单价 x 广告销售数量)

     = 平均 CPC x 广告点击数 /（商品单价 x 广告点击数 x 广告转化率）

     = 平均 CPC /（商品单价 x 广告转化率）
```

Maximum affordable CPC for Charge Rise II - category

| CPC  | U/P   | ACOS   | CVR   |
| ---- | ----- | ------ | ----- |
| 0.50 | 39.99 | 33.16% | 3.77% |
| 0.60 | 39.99 | 39.80% | 3.77% |
| 0.70 | 39.99 | 46.43% | 3.77% |
| 0.80 | 39.99 | 53.06% | 3.77% |

Theoretically, given these three constraints, (Unit Price=39.99, CVR=3.77%, and ACOS<=40%), the average CPC of this ads group should never exceed $0.60.

In short, the day to day task is to decide what bids we should offer for each keyword/asin, so that the target CPC<=0.60 (hence the target ACOS<=40%) of each ads campaign is met.

## Other Goals

There are other important goals, but they are out of the scope of managing ads and require extra resources:

1. increase click through rate (industry average=?)
2. increase clicks (on average 9K click per month)
3. increase conversion rate (on average between 3%-7%)
