ripgrep is a command line search tool like grep, but with a better user experience and faster.

## What is ripgrep

ripgrep is a line-oriented search tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern. By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip hidden files/directories and binary files.
