In this article I will show you how I configure Vim.

<!-- more -->

First create a `.vimrc` file in your home directory.

```
$ touch ~/.vimrc
```

I suggest that you create your own config file from scratch, starting with the very basic settings. Then gradually expand it bit by bit, little by little, as when you need certain features.

With the `.vimrc` one file configuration, you can achieve quite a lot already.

Secondly create the following directory structure in your home directory. This folder is mainly for plugin manager, color themes, and plugins.

```
.vim/
  ├── autoload/
  ├── backup/
  ├── colors/
  └── plugged/
```

```
$ mkdir -p ~/.vim ~/.vim/autoload ~/.vim/backup ~/.vim/colors ~/.vim/plugged
```
