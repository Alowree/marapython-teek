## 88. Meet the Substitute Command

## 89. Find and Replace Every Match in a File

## 90. Eyeball Each Substitution

Finding all occurrences of a pattern and blindly replacing them with something else won’t always work. Sometimes we need to look at each match and decide if it should be substituted. The `c` flag modifies the `:substitute` command to make this possible.

`:%s/pattern/target/gc`: `c` means "confirm each substitution"

We aren’t limited to just two answers. In fact, Vim helpfully reminds us of our options with the prompt “y/n/a/q/l/^E/^Y.” This table shows what each answer means:

| Trigger | Effect                                          |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `y`     | Substitute this match                           |
| `n`     | Skip this match                                 |
| `q`     | Quit substituting                               |
| `l`     | “last”—Substitute this match, then quit         |
| `a`     | “all”—Substitute this and any remaining matches |
| `<C-e>` | Scroll the screen up                            |
| `<C-y>` | Scroll the screen down                          |

You can also find this information in Vim’s help by looking up `:h :s_c`.
