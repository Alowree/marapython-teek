A few essential tips to improve your Vim speed and comfort. The most important is remapping Caps Lock to Escape, which makes switching modes much more ergonomic.

## Remap Caps Lock to Escape

The `Esc` key is vital for switching to Normal mode, but it's awkwardly placed. Remapping the `Caps Lock` key is a common and highly recommended optimization.

### On Windows

**Method 1: Registry File**

1. Save the following as a `.reg` file (e.g., `remap.reg`):
   ```reg
   Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
   [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout]
   "Scancode Map"=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,02,00,00,00,01,00,3a,00,00,00,00,00
   ```
2. Double-click the file to apply it.
3. Reboot your computer.

**Method 2: PowerToys**

Use the **Keyboard Manager** utility in Microsoft PowerToys for a graphical way to remap keys.

### On macOS

1. Open **System Settings** > **Keyboard**.
2. Click **Keyboard Shortcuts...** > **Modifier Keys**.
3. Change the "Caps Lock Key" to **Escape**.

## Speed Up Key Repeat

Faster key repeat makes navigating with `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` much quicker.

- **Windows:** Go to **Control Panel** > **Keyboard** and adjust the "Repeat rate" and "Repeat delay".
- **macOS:** Go to **System Settings** > **Keyboard** and adjust "Key repeat rate" and "Delay until repeat".

## Use the Dot `.` Command

The dot (`.`) command repeats your last change (e.g., an insertion, deletion, or modification). After changing a word with `cw`, you can move to another word and press `.` to apply the same change instantly.

## Combine Operators and Motions

Vim's grammar is `operator` + `motion`. This is a core concept.

- **Operators:** `d` (delete), `c` (change), `y` (yank/copy).
- **Motions:** `w` (word), `$` (end of line), `G` (end of file).

**Examples:**

- `dw`: Delete word.
- `d$`: Delete to the end of the line.
- `cG`: Change from the cursor to the end of the file.
- `y/foo`: Yank everything until the word "foo".
