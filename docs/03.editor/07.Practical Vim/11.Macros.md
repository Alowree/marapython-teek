## 65. Record and Execute a Macro

_Macros allow us to record a sequence of changes and then play them back. This tip shows how._

### Capture a Sequence of Commands by Recording a Macro

- `q{register}` start recording
- `qa` start recording into register a
- `q` stop recording
- `:reg a` inspect the contents of register a

### Play Back a Sequence of Commands by Executing a Macro

- `@{register}` executes the contents of the specified register
- `@a` executes the contents of register a
- `@@` repeats the macro that was invoked most recently
- `10@a` executes 10 times

## 66. Normalize, Strike, Abort

_Executing a macro can sometimes produce unexpected results, but we can achieve better consistency if we follow a handful of best practices._

### Normalize the Cursor Position

### Strike Your Target with a Repeatable Motion

### Abort When a Motion Fails

## 67. Play Back with a Count

## 68. Repeat a Change on Continuous Lines

## 69. Append Commands to a Macro

Sometimes we miss a vital step when we record a macro. There's no need to re-recording the whole thing from scratch. Instead, we can tack extra commands onto the end of an existing macro.

## 70. Act Upon a Collection of Files

## 71. Evaluate an Iterator to Number Items in a List

## 72. Edit the Contents of a Macro
