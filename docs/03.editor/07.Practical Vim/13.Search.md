## Tip 80. Meet the Search Command

_In this tip, we’ll cover the basics of using the search command, including how to specify the direction of a search, repeat (or reverse) the last search, and work with the search history._

- `/` search forward
- `?` search backward

| Command | Effect                                                             |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `n`     | Jump to next match, preserving direction and offset                |
| `N`     | Jump to previous match, preserving direction and offset            |
| `/<CR>` | Jump forward to next match of same pattern                         |
| `?<CR>` | Jump backward to previous match of same pattern                    |
| `gn`    | Enable character-wise Visual mode and select next search match     |
| `gN`    | Enable character-wise Visual mode and select previous search match |
