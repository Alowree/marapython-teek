### **Soundfreaq BFCM 2025: Aggressive Conversion & Domination Plan**

This plan is engineered for one purpose: to achieve maximum sales velocity and market share for Soundfreaq during the BFCM weekend through an aggressive, multi-layered promotional and advertising assault.

---

#### **1. The Promotion Combination: "Shock & Awe" Stacking**

The core of this strategy is to stack multiple offers to create a value proposition that is impossible for customers to ignore.

- **Layer 1: The Foundation - Best Deal (7-Day Deal)**

  - **Product:** Soundfreaq Double Spot (our hero SKU).
  - **Discount:** 25% Off. This is the main traffic driver and will be featured on the Amazon Deals page.
  - **Timing:** Must run the full week of Black Friday (Monday, Nov 25th - Monday, Dec 2nd).

- **Layer 2: The Accelerator - Tiered Coupons**

  - **Action:** Create aggressive, high-value coupons that are live **simultaneously** with the Best Deal.
  - **Coupon 1 (Hero SKU):** An additional **0 Off Coupon** specifically for the Soundfreaq Double Spot. This stacks with the 25% deal, creating a "deal-on-a-deal" effect.
  - **Coupon 2 (Catalog-wide):** **15% Off Coupon** on all other Soundfreaq products. This captures sales from traffic that the hero deal brings to our store.

- **Layer 3: The AOV Maximizer - Virtual Bundles**
  - **Action:** Create compelling bundles that are promoted heavily within our A+ Content and Storefront.
  - **Bundle 1 ("Ultimate Stereo Bundle"):** Two Soundfreaq Double Spots. The bundle itself has a 10% discount, and the customer can **still apply the 0 Off coupon**, creating an irresistible offer.
  - **Bundle 2 ("Home Audio Kit"):** One Double Spot + one Sound Spot. 15% off, plus the 15% off coupon can be applied.

**Why this works:** This combination drives massive traffic through the main "Best Deal," then uses high-value coupons and bundles to dramatically increase conversion rate and average order value. The visual of a strike-through price, a deal badge, AND an orange coupon badge is a proven conversion driver.

#### **2. The Advertising Strategy: "Search Result Domination"**

Our goal is to own the digital shelf for our most important keywords. This requires an aggressive, front-loaded budget and strategic targeting.

- **Phase 1: Pre-BFCM (Nov 1 - Nov 27) - "Harvesting & Targeting"**

  - **Budget:** 00/day.
  - **Campaigns:**
    - **Sponsored Products (SP) - Auto:** Run a low-budget automatic campaign on all ASINs to harvest new, relevant search terms.
    - **SP - Manual (Broad/Phrase):** Target mid-funnel keywords like "bluetooth speaker for party" and "loud portable speaker."
    - **Sponsored Display (SD):** Build retargeting audiences by targeting anyone who has viewed a Soundfreaq product page in the last 30 days.

- **Phase 2: Peak BFCM (Nov 28 - Dec 2) - "Domination"**
  - **Budget:** **Increase to $500 - $700/day.** The goal is not a low ACoS; the goal is maximum sales velocity.
  - **Campaigns:**
    - **SP - Manual (Exact Match):**
      - Create a new campaign targeting only the top 10-15 highest-converting keywords harvested from Phase 1.
      - **Bidding:** Use "Top of Search" placement modifiers and increase bids by **200-300%**. We must be in the top 3 ad slots for these terms.
    - **SP - Product Targeting (PAT):**
      - Aggressively target the product pages of our top 5 competitors. Increase bids by 150%.
    - **Sponsored Brands (SB):**
      - **Headline:** "BLACK FRIDAY: Soundfreaq Speakers up to 35% Off!"
      - **Landing Page:** A custom Storefront page showing ONLY the products on deal.
    - **Sponsored Display (SD):**
      - Launch a new campaign retargeting all viewers from the last 7 days with aggressive "Buy Now" messaging.

#### **3. The Operational Plan: "Flawless Execution Checklist"**

Mistakes during BFCM are costly. This checklist ensures perfect operational readiness.

- **Inventory (FBA):**

  - **Deadline:** All inventory for BFCM must be checked in at Amazon FBA centers no later than **November 10th, 2025.** This is non-negotiable.
  - **Quantity:** 8 weeks of stock cover for the hero SKU (Double Spot) and 6 weeks for all other products. It is better to be overstocked than to sell out.

- **Deal & Promotion Setup:**

  - **Best Deal Submission:** Submit the Double Spot for "Best Deal" consideration by the **October 18th, 2025** deadline.
  - **Coupon & Bundle Creation:** All coupons and virtual bundles must be created and scheduled to go live on November 28th by **November 20th**. Double-check start and end dates.

- **Listing & Storefront Optimization:**

  - **Content Freeze:** All listing titles, bullet points, A+ Content, and Storefront designs must be finalized and locked in by **November 22nd**. Do not make any changes during BFCM week to avoid indexing issues.
  - **BFCM Storefront Tab:** Create a dedicated "Black Friday" page on the Soundfreaq store and set it as the landing page for all Sponsored Brands ads.

- **Monitoring:**
  - **Hourly Checks (Nov 28 - Dec 2):**
    - **PPC Budgets:** Ensure campaigns do not run out of budget.
    - **Deal Status:** Confirm the Best Deal is active and running correctly.
    - **Competitor Pricing:** Monitor key competitors for any aggressive price changes.
    - **Inventory Levels:** Track sales velocity against inventory to project any potential stockout risks.
