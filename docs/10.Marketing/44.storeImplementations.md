# Soundfreaq.com Store: Holiday Promotion Implementation Plan

This document outlines a detailed, step-by-step plan to implement the three holiday promotion ideas for the Soundfreaq.com online store, which is built on WordPress and WooCommerce.

## 1. Implementation Plan

### Step 1: WooCommerce Product & Promotion Setup

1.  **Install Recommended Plugin:** To create compelling offers like bundles and "buy one, get one" deals, install the **"WPC Product Bundles for WooCommerce"** plugin. It offers a free version with sufficient features for these promotions.
2.  **Create the "Holiday Audio Bundle":**
    - In WooCommerce, create a new "Product Bundle".
    - Add "Sound Rise II" and "Sound Spot II" to the bundle.
    - Set a custom price for the bundle that reflects the 50% discount on the Sound Spot II. For example, if Sound Rise II is $99 and Sound Spot II is $79, the bundle price would be $99 + ($79 / 2) = $138.50.
3.  **Create the "Gift-Ready" Offer:**
    - Use the **"WooCommerce All in One BOGO Deals"** plugin or a similar "Buy One Get One" plugin.
    - Create a rule: If a customer adds "Sound Rise II" to their cart, automatically add the "Wireless Charging Pad" product to their cart for free.
    - Ensure the "Wireless Charging Pad" is an existing product in WooCommerce (even if it's hidden from the main shop page).
4.  **Create the "Dual Streaming System" Bundle:**
    - Similar to the Holiday Audio Bundle, create a new "Product Bundle".
    - Add two "Sound Spot II" speakers to the bundle.
    - Set the special discounted price for the bundle (e.g., $119).

### Step 2: Landing Page Creation

1.  **Install a Page Builder:** If not already in use, install a user-friendly page builder like **Elementor** or **Beaver Builder**. The free versions are very capable.
2.  **Create a New Page:** In WordPress, create a new page titled "Holiday Gift Shop" or "Black Friday Deals".
3.  **Design the Landing Page:** Use the page builder to design the landing page according to the structure outlined in Section 2 below. This will be the central hub for all Instagram ad traffic.

### Step 3: Instagram Stories & Advertising

1.  **Create Visuals:**
    - Design 3-5 visually appealing Instagram Story graphics for each promotion.
    - Use high-quality product photos, festive backgrounds, and clear, bold text.
    - Create short video stories (15-30 seconds) showcasing the products in a holiday setting.
2.  **Set Up Ad Campaign:**
    - In Facebook Ads Manager, create a new campaign with the objective of "Traffic" or "Conversions".
    - Target audiences based on interests (e.g., home audio, tech gadgets, interior design) and create a retargeting audience for past website visitors.
    - Set up your ad creative using the visuals created in the previous step.
    - Write compelling ad copy that highlights the limited-time nature of the offers.

### Step 4: Drive Traffic to Landing Page

1.  **Use a Clear Call-to-Action (CTA):** In your Instagram Stories and ads, use a clear CTA like "Shop Now" or "Get the Deal".
2.  **Link to the Landing Page:** Ensure the "swipe up" link in your stories and the link in your ads directs users straight to the new "Holiday Gift Shop" landing page you created.

### Step 5: Analytics and Tracking

1.  **Install Facebook Pixel:** Make sure the Facebook Pixel is correctly installed on your WordPress site to track ad performance and conversions.
2.  **Use Google Analytics:** Set up goals in Google Analytics to track how many visitors from the campaign complete a purchase.
3.  **Monitor and Optimize:** Regularly check the performance of your ads and make adjustments to targeting, creative, or budget as needed.
