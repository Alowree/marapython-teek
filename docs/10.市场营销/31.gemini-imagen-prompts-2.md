### **User Guideline: Generating Photorealistic Product Imagery with Gemini Imagen**

**Objective:** To create ultrarealistic, professional-quality images of Soundfreaq products in hotel environments for marketing use.

The key to photorealism is detail and specificity. A great prompt will instruct the AI not just _what_ to create, but _how_ to "photograph" it.

#### **1. The Core Principles of a Photorealistic Prompt**

To avoid a "generated" or "fake" look, every prompt should be built on the following five pillars:

1. **Precise Subject Description:** Be exact. Name the product, its color, its material, and any visible state.

   - _Instead of:_ "Soundfreaq alarm clock"
   - _Use:_ "A black Soundfreaq Sound Rise alarm clock with its red LED display showing 7:15 AM."

2. **Detailed Environment & Staging:** Describe the immediate surroundings with texture, color, and secondary objects. This grounds the product in reality.

   - _Instead of:_ "on a nightstand"
   - _Use:_ "on a dark mahogany hotel nightstand, next to a pair of eyeglasses and a half-full glass of water."

3. **Specific Lighting Conditions:** This is the most critical element for realism. Describe the light's source, color, and intensity.

   - _Instead of:_ "in a hotel room"
   - _Use:_ "illuminated by soft, warm light from a bedside lamp" or "lit by cool, early morning sunlight filtering through a large window."

4. **Photographic & Compositional Language:** Tell the AI to think like a camera. Specify the shot type, lens, and focus. This is the secret to a professional look.

   - _Instead of:_ "a picture of a speaker"
   - _Use:_ "A close-up, eye-level professional product photograph..."
   - _Advanced:_ "...shot on a DSLR with a 50mm f/1.8 lens, creating a shallow depth of field with a softly blurred background."

5. **Overall Mood & Style:** Define the desired aesthetic.
   - _Examples:_ "Cinematic," "Minimalist," "Cozy and inviting," "Luxury and sleek."

#### **2. A Formula for Success**

Combine the principles into a structured prompt.

`[Style] + [Shot Type] of a [Precise Subject Description] + [Detailed Environment & Staging] + [Specific Lighting Conditions] + [Camera/Lens Details]`

#### **3. Prompt Examples: From Basic to Ultrarealistic**

Hereâ€™s how to apply the formula to your products.

##### **Product: Soundfreaq Sound Rise (Alarm Clock)**

**Goal:** A classic, welcoming nightstand photo.

- **Level 3: Ultrarealistic Prompt (Marketing Quality)**

  > `**Ultrarealistic, professional product photograph** of a **black Soundfreaq Sound Rise alarm clock** on a **dark walnut nightstand in a luxury hotel room**. The clock's digital display is glowing softly. The scene is illuminated by **warm, gentle light from a modern bedside lamp that is just out of frame**. **Shot on a Sony A7 IV camera with an 85mm f/1.4 lens, creating a tack-sharp focus on the product with a beautifully soft, out-of-focus background** showing a hint of a neatly made bed.`

#### **4. Quick Reference: Do's and Don'ts**

| Do                                                                                                 | Don't                                         |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| **Be hyper-specific** about the product model and color.                                           | Use vague terms like "a speaker."             |
| **Describe materials and textures** (e.g., "brushed metal," "dark walnut," "matte black plastic"). | Forget to describe the surfaces.              |
| **Specify the light source, color, and direction.**                                                | Just say "well-lit."                          |
| **Use professional camera and lens terminology.**                                                  | Ask for "a photo" or "an image."              |
| **Add small, realistic details** (a cable, a book, a phone).                                       | Leave the product floating in an empty scene. |
| **Define the mood** (e.g., "cozy," "sleek," "serene").                                             | Assume the AI knows the feeling you want.     |
