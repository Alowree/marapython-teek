Here are 15 example prompts designed to showcase Gemini’s ability to generate realistic photos, along with explanations of why each prompt is effective:

Prompt: “A photorealistic close-up of a dew-covered spiderweb in the morning light, with a shallow depth of field and bokeh in the background.”
Why it works: This prompt specifies details like “photorealistic,” “close-up,” “dew-covered,” “morning light,” and “shallow depth of field,” which all contribute to a realistic and visually appealing image.

Prompt: “A candid street photograph of a woman laughing while talking on a vintage rotary phone in a bustling New York City street, shot with a Leica M6 and 35mm lens.”
Why it works: It includes specific equipment (Leica M6, 35mm lens), which helps the AI grasp the desired aesthetic. The terms “candid” and “bustling” add to the realism and narrative.

Prompt: “A photorealistic portrait of an elderly fisherman with weathered skin and a long white beard, sitting on a wooden dock with fishing nets in the background, at sunset.”
Why it works: This prompt focuses on details like “weathered skin,” “long white beard,” and “fishing nets,” which evoke a sense of realism and age. The “sunset” lighting adds warmth and atmosphere.

Prompt: “A hyperrealistic image of a single raindrop clinging to a vibrant green leaf, macro photography, natural light, high resolution.”
Why it works: “Hyperrealistic” and “macro photography” explicitly tell the AI to focus on minute details. “Natural light” ensures a realistic lighting scenario.

Prompt: “A photorealistic interior of a modern minimalist living room with large windows overlooking a snow-covered forest, warm lighting, Scandinavian design.”
Why it works: This prompt combines architectural style (Scandinavian design) with specific lighting (warm lighting) and environmental details (snow-covered forest) to create a complete and realistic scene.

Prompt: “A close-up shot of a chef preparing sushi, showcasing the intricate details of the rice and fish, bright studio lighting, professional food photography.”
Why it works: Using the phrase “professional food photography” instructs the AI to emulate the style and quality of professionally shot food images. The specific details (rice, fish) enhance realism.

Prompt: “A photorealistic image of the Milky Way galaxy stretching across a clear night sky above a rocky mountain range, long exposure, dark ambient lighting.”
Why it works: “Long exposure” is a technical photography term that informs the AI about the image capture technique. Describing the scene (Milky Way, rocky mountain range) provides context.

Prompt: “A photorealistic portrait of a tabby cat with green eyes, lying on a plush velvet cushion, soft focus background.”
Why it works: This prompt combines specific animal details (tabby cat, green eyes) with luxurious textures (plush velvet cushion) and photographic techniques (soft focus) to create a visually appealing and realistic image.

Prompt: “A photorealistic image of an old, leather-bound book lying open on a wooden table, illuminated by candlelight, chiaroscuro lighting.”
Why it works: “Chiaroscuro lighting” is a specific lighting style (strong contrast between light and dark) that adds drama and realism. The details (leather-bound book, candlelight) contribute to the overall atmosphere.

Prompt: “A photorealistic photograph of a bustling farmers market on a sunny Saturday morning, overflowing with colorful fruits and vegetables, shallow depth of field.”
Why it works: The prompt evokes a lively scene with “bustling farmers market” and “overflowing with colorful fruits and vegetables,” prompting the AI to generate a detailed and realistic image.

Prompt: “A photorealistic image of a vintage airplane soaring through a cloudy sky at sunset, dramatic lighting, aerial perspective.”
Why it works: Combining “vintage airplane” with “dramatic lighting” and “aerial perspective” creates a dynamic and visually striking image. The specific time of day (sunset) adds to the atmosphere.

Prompt: “A photorealistic close-up of a human eye, showing intricate details of the iris and eyelashes, natural lighting, high resolution.”
Why it works: Focusing on the “intricate details” of the eye and specifying “high resolution” encourages the AI to generate a highly detailed and realistic image.

Prompt: “A photorealistic image of a cup of coffee with latte art in the shape of a heart, sitting on a wooden table in a cozy cafe, warm lighting.”
Why it works: The prompt includes specific details like “latte art in the shape of a heart” and “cozy cafe,” which add to the realism and appeal of the image. “Warm lighting” enhances the overall atmosphere.

Prompt: “A photorealistic image of a majestic lion resting in the African savanna at golden hour, long grass, shallow depth of field.”
Why it works: “Golden hour” is a specific time of day known for its warm, soft light. Describing the environment (African savanna, long grass) provides context and enhances realism.

Prompt: “A photorealistic image of a futuristic cityscape at night, with flying cars and neon lights reflecting on wet streets, cyberpunk aesthetic.”
Why it works: The prompt combines futuristic elements (flying cars, neon lights) with specific visual details (wet streets) and a defined aesthetic (cyberpunk) to create a coherent and realistic image of a fictional world.
