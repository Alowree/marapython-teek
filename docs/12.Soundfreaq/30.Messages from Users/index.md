This section captures some of the lovely emails that we receive from users, typically who have been using their Soundfreaqs for many years and therefore possess a deep insight into why some tiny features are extremely useful in their daily lives. In most cases, these features are so small that they are omitted from almost all of the product reviews, and even missing from the marketing materials.

Product managers and marketing managers should always listen to the voice of the customer, and understand what is truly important to the user.
