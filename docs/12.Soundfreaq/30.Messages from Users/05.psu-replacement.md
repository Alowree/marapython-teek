### Sound Rise Classic (SFQ-14)

### Sound Rise II (SFQ-16)

This model requires a specific, high-output power adapter.

- **Required Specs:** 13V 4.6A
- **DC Plug Type:** Center Positive
- **DC Plug Size:** 5.5mm x 2.5mm (Outer x Inner Diameter)
- **Recommended Option:** [Universal 13.5V Adapter on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Basicvolt-Universal-Switching-Replacement-Security/dp/B0BY8NZ6JC)
- **Note:**
  - The most important thing is to make sure that the package includes the correct DC plug size (connector C: 5.5 mm x 2.5 mm). You may want to double-check with the store before making a purchase.
  - The recommended universal adapter is 13.5V 3A max. While this adapter is compatible, it will not supply enough power for the speaker and all three charging ports to operate at full capacity. This will result in a downgrade in the Sound Rise II's charging performance.
