There are two separate steps involved in uploading your product user manual to the `user-guides` page.

## Media

### Library

With this tool, you can manage the media resources that you have uploaed to the website. Typically, these are the images or PDF files that are used on your website.

You can delete the resources that are outdated and no longer needed.

- delete individual file
- delete in bulk

### Add New Media File

Drop files to upload or <button>Select Files</button>

Maximum upload file size: 3 MB. <a href="#">Change</a>

The file size used to be 2.5 MB, you can click the <a href="#">Change</a> button to modify the file size, for example, to 3.0 MB.

Note when you are uploading a user manual in PDF, make sure you have converted the file to be vector based, instead of to be image based, where the file can be pixelized and degraded during the conversion.

## Pages

Once you have finished converting and uploading the file, copy the generated URL and simply go to the `user-guides` page and edit the link accordingly.
