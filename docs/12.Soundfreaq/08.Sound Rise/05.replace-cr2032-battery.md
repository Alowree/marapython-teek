The Sound Rise uses a CR2302 button cell battery to maintain user settings such as time and alarm.

A customer says he has the SFQ-08 and is trying to change the button battery but the screw is so small. He needs some guidance as to how to open the battery compartment.

Well, on the cover of the battery compartment, it's actually a standard Philips screw, just smaller, see attached photo. He just needs to find the right screwdriver.

I'm no expert on screws, but I asked one of our colleagues in the office.

From small to large, we only use #0, #1 and #2, these three different sizes of Philips screws in all our product lines. We don't use #3 and above. In the case of his battery replacement, he should find a tip size #0 Philips screwdriver to do the job.
