::: details How to turn off the Alarm on Sound Rise SFQ-08?

When Alarm 1 is set (with the Alarm 1 icon displayed), short pressing the Alarm 1 button will display the alarm setting for approximately 6 seconds and then return to the current time.

To cancel Alarm 1, press the Alarm 1 button once to display the alarm setting and press the Alarm 1 button again within the 6 seconds before the current time is displayed. `OFF` will be displayed briefly, then the current time will return. The Alarm 1 icon will now disappear.
