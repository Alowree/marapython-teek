## Soundfreaq has earned a reputation as a leading audio company

“To our ears Soundfreaq **sounded great and had excellent bass** response for such a small unit.”
“Sound Step Recharge is a great package overall: it offers solid sound quality and some innovative design touches... truly iPad-ready speakers.”
“Exemplifies gorgeous.”
“Soundfreag came out of nowhere to deliver a product few others can match, they include tons of little extras that established brands such as Sony, Logitech, Philips and Creative, just don't deliver.”

## 声誉卓著，Soundfreaq 已成为领先的音响公司

“在我们听来，Soundfreaq 这个小巧的音箱，**音质卓越，低音强劲**。”
“Sound Step Recharge 是一款出色的产品：音质可靠，设计新颖……是真正为 iPad 设计的音箱。”
“华丽的典范。”
“Soundfreaq 横空出世，带来了竞争对手难以匹敌的产品。他们还加入了许多索尼、罗技、飞利浦、创新等知名品牌所没有的额外功能。”

## With praise from the most influential and respected tech media

“The sound is simply great. I could hear the attack of every plucked note more clearly on the Sound Stack [than the Zeppelin]. Nicely defined bass with zero distortion. A plethora of connection options. Hot looks.”
“Yes, this is the real thing. It sounds like music with little noise, no distortion. Even so, against that tough competition from Bowers & Wilkins, I'd still give the advantage to the Sound Stack.”
“In my tests, the combination produced audio that sounded as if it were from a larger, fancier rig.”
“Soundfreag doesn't release speaker systems often, but it's safe to expect something spectacularly sexy when it does. Such is exactly the case with its latest audiophile-aimed creation,the Sound Stack wireless speaker.”

## 备受赞誉，获得最具影响力和最受尊敬的科技媒体的好评

“音质简直太棒了。在 Sound Stack 上，我能更清晰地听到每一个拨弦音的起音 [比 Zeppelin 更好]。低音清晰，零失真。连接选项丰富。外观时尚。”
“是的，这就是真材实料。它听起来就像音乐，几乎没有噪音，没有失真。即便如此，面对 Bowers & Wilkins 的激烈竞争，我仍然会选择 Sound Stack。”
“在我的测试中，这种组合产生的音频听起来就像是来自一个更大、更高级的设备。”
“Soundfreaq 不常发布音箱系统，但每次发布都值得期待其惊艳的魅力。其最新面向发烧友的创作——Sound Stack 无线音箱，正是如此。”
