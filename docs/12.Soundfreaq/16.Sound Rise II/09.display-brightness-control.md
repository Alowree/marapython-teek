A great deal of thought went into the design of the Sound Rise II.

## User criticism

First message:

> So this morning I woke up again to your annoying default alarm rather than using the Bluetooth that was all set up. This happens way too often since I got the device where your Sound Rise II doesn’t play my Bluetooth that is all set up. And it makes for a bad morning.
>
> I don’t understand why you can just add an option to read from a USB folder and play songs from that. You have the ports. Keep it simpler that way I don’t have to worry about setting up my phone every night.
>
> And also speaking of problems when you shut off the alarm it’s stupid that you then have to re-lower your brightness setting if you adjusted it.
>
> With that being said I will be finding an alternative to your product even though the form factor is good as well as the sound quality, physical buttons, and screen brightness adjustability with it going to max brightness when the alarm is on.

Second message:

> I always have the screen at the lowest brightness or second lowest during the night. The alarm goes off and plays music on the good days or sounds on the bad day. It can be 15-30 minutes before I hit the button to turn it off. But the screen stays on. I only hit the button once but it shuts off the music right away.

## PRD Definition

> The behavior is the same for both the Home version and the Hotel version of the Sound Rise II.

The `DIMMER` button controls the brightness of the LCD backlight. There are six levels of brightness control for the LED backlight. Press the DIMMER button repeatedly to cycle through the six available brightness levels (Level 1 to Level 6). The clock saves your chosen setting until you adjust it again.

| Level | Brightness |
| ----- | ---------- |
| 5     | 100%       |
| 4     | 75%        |
| 3     | 50%        |
| 2     | 25%        |
| 1     | 5%         |
| 0     | 1%         |

> The supplier has been advised to refer to that of SFQ-08 for the actual brightness of each level for Sound Rise II development.

## ☀️ Display Brightness Control

### 1. Static Brightness Levels (Levels 3 - 6)

When set to any of these levels, the display brightness is **constant** and will **not change** when you interact with the clock or when the alarm sounds.

| Level | Brightness (%)     | Description                                                              |
| :---: | :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **6** | **100%** (Maximum) | The display remains at maximum brightness for easy viewing at all times. |
| **5** | **75%**            | The display remains at 75% brightness at all times.                      |
| **4** | **50%**            | The display remains at 50% brightness at all times.                      |
| **3** | **25%**            | The display remains at 25% brightness at all times.                      |

### 2. Dynamic Low-Light Levels (Levels 1 - 2)

These settings are designed for sleeping, keeping the display extremely dim until you need to use the clock. **Level 5 (75% brightness)** is the temporary bright setting used for interaction.

| Level | Brightness (%)        | When a button is pressed                                                                            | When the alarm goes off         | After Snooze/Alarm Off                                                                                                       |
| :---: | :-------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **2** | **5%** (Very Dim)     | Temporarily brightens to **75% (Level 5)** for **eight seconds**, then reverts to **5% (Level 2)**. | Brightens to **75% (Level 5)**. | **Snooze:** Returns to **5% (Level 2)** eight seconds after pressing SNOOZE.<br>**Alarm Off:** Remains at **75% (Level 5)**. |
| **1** | **1%** (Minimum Glow) | Temporarily brightens to **75% (Level 5)** for **eight seconds**, then reverts to **1% (Level 1)**. | Brightens to **75% (Level 5)**. | **Snooze:** Returns to **1% (Level 1)** eight seconds after pressing SNOOZE.<br>**Alarm Off:** Remains at **75% (Level 5)**. |

As the LCD brightness increases to **75% (Level 5)** when the alarm goes off, and remains at this level when the alarm is switched off manually, you will need to dim it before going to bed at night.

## Recommended ECN

Modify the brightness behavior as according the original PRD definition, as follows, highlighted in ==YELLOW==:

| Level | Brightness                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 5     | Remains at `Level 5` regardless of any user interaction other than brightness reset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 4     | Remains at `Level 4` regardless of any user interaction other than brightness reset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 3     | Remains at `Level 3` regardless of any user interaction other than brightness reset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 2     | Remains at `Level 2` regardless of any user interaction other than brightness reset.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 1     | Remains at `Level 1` when no user operations are being performed. Pressing any button increases the brightness temporarily to `Level 4` for eight seconds, after which it reverts to `Level 1`. When the alarm goes off, the brightness increases to `Level 4` temporarily, returning to `Level 1` eight seconds after the `SNOOZE` button is pressed. However, if the alarm is silenced manually, the brightness will return to `Level 1`. |
| 0     | Remains at `Level 0` when no user operations are being performed. Pressing any button increases the brightness temporarily to `Level 4` for eight seconds, after which it reverts to `Level 0`. When the alarm goes off, the brightness increases to `Level 4` temporarily, returning to `Level 1` eight seconds after the `SNOOZE` button is pressed. However, if the alarm is silenced manually, the brightness will return to `Level 0`. |

## Quick Turn Around

I will suggest the customer to try setting on brightness `level 2`, as it will not return to max brightness.

This brightness behavior — the display automatically lights up to `level 4` when at `level 0` and `level 1` and after the alarm being manually turned off — is a well thought-out design and considered an improvement on the original Sound Rise SFQ-08. However, for the very same feature, some troll it, and others appreciate it.

## Customer praise

> I just wanted to take a moment to let you know that we are very pleased with our new Rise II, and we are enjoying the additional features it offers over the original Rise. We are loving the ability to turn the display off when ready for sleep, and having it automatically illuminate when the alarm is activated, as my wife is very sensitive to light while sleeping. That was great thinking, on someone's part. —Duane F.
